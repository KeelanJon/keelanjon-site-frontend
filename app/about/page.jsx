                I‚Äôm a web developer and creative generalist based in South
                Wales, UK, with over 5 years of experience blending design,
                development, and visual storytelling. I build fast, modern
                websites that prioritise user experience, responsive design, and
                SEO‚Äîhelping businesses stand out and grow online. With a strong
                foundation in both code and creativity, I also craft 3D visuals
                for web, games, and film, bridging the gap between functional
                interfaces and compelling digital experiences.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6 text-justify">
                My journey started in a small Welsh town, where I grew up
                sketching characters and loving technology. After studying
                software engineering and working in IT, I found my stride in web
                development‚Äîa place where logic met creativity. In 2020, I
                discovered 3D art through Blender opening up a whole new world,
                and sharing that passion online quickly grew into a thriving
                creator career. Today, I combine my love for development and
                design with a growing online audience of over 200,000 fellow
                creatives, teaching, building, and exploring the edges of what‚Äôs
                possible on the web.
